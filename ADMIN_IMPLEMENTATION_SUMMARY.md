## 🎯 How It Works

### Product Creation Flow
1. Admin navigates to `/admin/products/new`
2. Fills out product form with all details
3. Uploads multiple images (stored in Supabase Storage)
4. Adds colors with hex codes
5. Adds sizes with stock quantities
6. Adds feature tags
7. Submits form
8. System creates:
   - Product record in `products` table
   - Image records in `product_images` table
   - Color records in `product_colors` table
   - Size records in `product_sizes` table
   - Feature records in `product_features` table

### Product Editing Flow
1. Admin clicks "Edit" on product list
2. System loads all product data including relations
3. Admin can:
   - Update basic information
   - Add new images
   - Delete existing images
   - Modify colors, sizes, features
   - Add new variants
   - Delete existing variants (with confirmation)
4. Saves changes
5. System updates all related tables

### Order Management Flow
1. Admin views all orders at `/admin/orders`
2. Can search by order number or customer name
3. Can filter by order status
4. Clicks "View Details" to see full order
5. Modal shows:
   - Order information (number, date, total)
   - Customer details
   - Shipping address
   - All order items with product details
6. Can update order status with one click
7. Changes are saved immediately to database

## 📊 Database Structure

### Products
```
products (main table)
├── product_images (1:many)
├── product_colors (1:many)
├── product_sizes (1:many)
└── product_features (1:many)
```

### Orders
```
orders (main table)
├── order_items (1:many)
├── user_profiles (many:1) - Customer info
└── user_addresses (many:1) - Shipping address
```

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Admin Verification
- All admin routes check `is_admin = true` via `isUserAdmin()` helper
- Non-admin users are redirected to homepage
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to sign-in

### Storage Security
- Only admins can upload/delete images
- Public can read/view images
- RLS policies enforce admin checks

### Data Validation
- Required fields enforced on forms
- File type and size validation
- Numeric validation for prices and quantities
- Hex code validation for colors

## 🚀 Next Steps

### To Use the Admin Panel:

1. **Set yourself as admin:**
   ```sql
   UPDATE user_profiles 
   SET is_admin = true 
   WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'YOUR_EMAIL');
   ```

2. **Sign in to your app**

3. **Navigate to `/admin`**

4. **Add your first product:**
   - Click "Product Management"
   - Click "Add New Product"
   - Fill in the form
   - Upload images
   - Add variants
   - Click "Create Product"

5. **View and manage orders:**
   - Click "Order Management"
   - Search and filter orders
   - Update order statuses

### Customer-Facing Features (Next Phase):
After populating products via admin panel, build:
- Product catalog on homepage
- Product detail pages
- Shopping cart
- Checkout process
- Customer order history

## 📝 Technical Notes

### Image Upload
- Images are uploaded to `product-images` bucket
- File names: `{productId}/{timestamp}_{index}.{ext}`
- Public URLs are generated automatically
- Display order is preserved

### Dynamic Forms
- Colors, sizes, and features use dynamic array state
- Each item has unique ID for tracking
- "New" items are marked with `is_new` flag
- Existing items update in database
- New items are inserted

### Order Status Flow
Typical order progression:
1. **pending** - Order placed, payment pending
2. **processing** - Payment confirmed, preparing order
3. **shipped** - Order sent to customer
4. **delivered** - Customer received order
5. **cancelled** - Order cancelled (any stage)

### Performance Considerations
- Images loaded on-demand with lazy loading
- Order list uses pagination-ready structure
- Product lists use indexed queries
- Search uses indexed columns
